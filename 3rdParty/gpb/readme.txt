This file contains the Python package for the Google Protocol Buffers library,
required to use the classes in src/common/gpb/python/.

It was built from the 2.6.1 source code package, downloaded from:
https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/downloads

Note that the protocol buffers used by this project make use of protobuf 2.6
features, so 2.6 is the minimum version of the library to run the code.

To install:

  sudo easy_install protobuf-2.6.1-py2.7.egg
