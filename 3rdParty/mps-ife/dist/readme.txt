    Team,

    LLS Delivery #1 for MPS Qual is attached.  It consists of the following:

    1 – RPM tar file (including dependencies)
    2 – RPM installation and Qual command usage instructions
    3 – Drawings for loopback cables for RS485 and GPIO.

    Regards,
    Ali


Note: I did not include the following RPMs that were delivered with the drop,
because they duplicate the ones already in the Qual software image:

    libsodium-1.0.6-2.x86_64.rpm
    protobuf-2.6.1-1.el7.centos.x86_64.rpm
    protobuf-c-1.2.1-1.el7.centos.x86_64.rpm
    zeromq4-4.1.4-5.x86_64.rpm
    czmq-3.0.2-4.x86_64.rpm
